# Data Science
**2020 Esri Developer Summit - Pre-Summit Hands-on Training Mar 8-9, 2020**

This training requires prior knowledge of Python 3.  The class, taught by an experienced data scientist, teaches introductory data science skills and libraries, including NumPy and Pandas, as well as how to graphically explore and chart data.  As part of the training, students will learn how to define actionable analytic questions and (time permitting) will also learn how to handle missing data.

## Class Prerequisites

All attendees must have substantial prior programming experience. Since Python is only briefly introduced, we highly recommend prior familiarity with Python.

## Technical Setup and Requirements

All downloads and installs must be done before class to ensure an on-time start.

- A recent version of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux, with the latest system updates and at least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Anaconda** installed, from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ , which gives you a self-contained Python environment with some pre-installed libraries, an editor, etc.
  - Please download and install the current **Python 3** version of Anaconda (as of this writing, the latest version is Anaconda 2019.10, which includes Python 3.7.4).
  - Please use the default options during installation.
  - This will typically install Python and the other Anaconda software in a directory such as "C:\Users\YourUserName\Anaconda3".
  - The Anaconda bundle includes Spyder IDE (useful for writing full, complex Python programs) and Jupyter Notebook (useful for running small pieces of Python code and seeing results right away).
  - To verify the installation, confirm that you are able to launch the applications named **Spyder** and **Jupyter Notebook** on your computer.
- **Lab files** for class â€“ please download this zip file to your computer and unzip the contents to a convenient location such as the desktop.
  - http://lib.accelebrate.com/202003_Esri/ESRI.zip
- Please download the eBook linked in the Esri email (O'Reilly's Python Data Science Handbook).  This will be referenced during class in the materials you will receive.
